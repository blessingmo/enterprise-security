#Enterprise Security Engineering & Architecture Portfolio
Cloud Security • IAM & Zero Trust • Kubernetes Security • DevSecOps • AI Security • Threat Modeling • Architecture Design

This portfolio showcases my end-to-end capability to design, build, and secure modern enterprise systems across cloud, identity, DevSecOps, application security, and AI. It contains production-grade security baselines, hands-on implementations, and architecture reference designs that demonstrate how I approach security as an engineer, architect, and system thinker.

This work represents continuous development, learning, relearning and building of structured deep practice, aligned with my long-term goal of becoming an Enterprise Security Architect with strong expertise in AI Security and Identity & Access Governance.


##What This Portfolio Demonstrates
###Security Engineering depth

Real implementations showing mastery of Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, and cloud-native security patterns.

###Architecture-level thinking

Diagrams, system designs, threat models, and reference architectures for Zero Trust, IAM, API security, data security, DR, and secure cloud foundations.

###Identity & Access Management expertise

Full coverage of IAM architecture: OAuth2/OIDC, SAML, SCIM automation, PAM, IGA, JIT/PIM, least-privilege design, and multi-cloud identity governance.

###DevSecOps + Infrastructure Security

Understanding of CI/CD security pipelines, policy-as-code, Kubernetes hardening, runtime detection, supply-chain security, and secure SDLC integration.

###AI Security capability

LLM threat modeling, secure RAG architecture, AI supply-chain analysis, secure MLOps pipelines, and model misuse detection.

###Threat modeling proficiency

STRIDE, attack trees, data-flow analysis, and architecture-level risk assessments across multiple systems and technologies.

##Goal of This Repository

To provide clear, verifiable evidence of my ability to:

Design secure cloud and identity architectures

Build secure, automated, scalable systems

Assess and mitigate real-world risks

Integrate security into DevOps and ML pipelines

Support enterprise-scale engineering and architecture decisions

##This portfolio reflects my path toward senior roles, such as:

Security Engineer (Mid/Senior/Lead)

IAM Engineer / IAM Architect

Cloud Security Engineer

Security Architect

AI Security Engineer

##Structure Overview

The repository is organised into:

Hands-on labs

Production-ready security baselines

Reference architectures

Threat models

Automation scripts/tools

Enterprise projects (the high-value ones)

Documentation, whitepapers, presentations

Each folder is documented with objectives, architectures, decisions, and implementation details.
