<img width="800" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b0685b6-1e5f-4308-98ad-c52eb309e3b7" />


## Cloud Security • IAM & Zero Trust • Kubernetes Security • DevSecOps • AI Security • Threat Modeling • Architecture Design

This portfolio showcases my end-to-end capability to design, build, and secure modern enterprise systems across cloud, identity, DevSecOps, application security, and AI. It contains production-grade security baselines, hands-on labs, and architecture reference designs that demonstrate how I approach security as an engineer, architect, and system thinker.

This work represents continuous development, learning, relearning and building of structured deep practice, aligned with my long-term goal of becoming an Enterprise Security Architect with strong expertise in AI Security and Identity & Access Governance.

## My Approach to Security Engineering and Architecture

My background spans Security Operations, Cloud Security, Identity & Access Management, DevSecOps, and AI. Over the years, I’ve learned that impactful security engineering requires more than shiny tools;  it requires systems thinking, architectural clarity, and the ability to translate risk into pragmatic engineering decisions.

This portfolio reflects that philosophy.

Every project here demonstrates not only how something works, but why it is designed that way, what threats it mitigates, and how it scales in real enterprise environments. My goal is to continually develop toward an Enterprise Security Architect role with strong depth in cloud/edge computing, IAM, and emerging AI systems.

This repository is the result of deliberate daily practice, structured learning, and the design of real-world scenarios. It documents how I solve problems, design systems, and how I approach secure architecture in a way that balances usability, scalability, and measurable risk reduction.


## 1. What This Portfolio Demonstrates
This portfolio serves as a demonstration of:
My understanding;
- Secure cloud architectures (Azure & AWS)
My ability to;

- Harden Kubernetes, workloads, APIs, and infrastructure at scale
- Conduct advanced threat modeling for complex systems
- Apply AI Security concepts across LLMs, RAG pipelines, and ML supply chains
- Develop security reference architectures for enterprise environments
